      "test": "There are people who enter your life and take up space and then there are people who enter, leave footprints, and you will never forget; Seth Blanchard is the kind of person who I will never forget. I was receiving benefits in every aspect of my life at a time when I was terminated from a company I loved. The service and patience that I was given by this particular Benchmark Consultant were superb and the results even greater. I was given three weeks to find a job and had faith that, together, we could get it done. While he searched, I searched, and before the end of week one, I had landed a couple of interviews. Awaiting call backs in week 2, I landed a few more interviews and before I could hang up the phone with a potential employer, I was offered a position. Upon accepting it I knew that there was one more opportunity that I wanted to take advantage of, and in doing so, I landed my first interview, second interview, screenings and began my first day on the job. I believe that if I had not had Seth in my corner helping me with my resume or assisting me with what to ask in an interview, I would have missed my dream job. Thank you so much for your dedication and passion for helping me and others like me. It has all truly been a blessing!",
