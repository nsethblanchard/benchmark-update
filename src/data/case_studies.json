        "A.N., a single mother of 3, holds an Associates Degree in Fine Arts.  Prior to 2013, she was enrolled in a nursing program and working towards her chosen career.  At that time, however, a series of poor decisions resulted in her being convicted of felony conspiracy to manufacture and distribute drugs, for which she served jail time.  Additionally, she had several misdemeanor convictions for petit larceny.",
        "Having served her time, A.N. was ready to begin once again working towards the future she had envisioned. During our first meeting, I spent significant time counseling her that, due to her criminal background, her professional goals were now out of the picture for at least some period of time.  I stressed that at this juncture she must focus on redirecting her energies to rebuild as strong and solid an employment record as possible.  An obvious barrier to this plan was the relative scarcity of employers who are willing to consider hiring a convicted felon and indeed, despite having submitted applications on her own, she had been unable to secure any interviews.",
        "Through extensive experience assisting individuals in this position, I have developed a comprehensive list of amenable employers and so was able to streamline her job search considerably and avoid continued failure and frustration.   In addition to assisting her with job applications and creating a résumé́, I counseled her in how she should handle discussion of this criminal background in job interviews.  As we visited various work sites to submit applications and/or résumés, I urged her whenever possible to hand these directly to the decision-maker and establish a positive personal connection prior to the criminal history being discussed.",
        "A.N. quickly received several interview requests and within 2 weeks had secured a line job at a local manufacturing facility.  She was quickly identified as possessing higher potential and was promoted to a clerical position with better pay good promotion potential."

        "B.G. holds an Associates Degree in Business Administration; however he faced several significant challenges in his job search.  He has no transportation and lost his driver’s license due to multiple Driving While Intoxicated convictions.  In addition to this, he has had two Drunk in Public misdemeanors as well as one for Assault.",
        "During our initial meeting for gathering information and discussing history, we began by creating a résumé́ for him which highlighted his work experience in fast food management.  Additionally, since he did not have an email address through which to communicate with potential employers, I set one up for him and linked it to his phone, allowing him immediate notice of automated responses to his applications.",
        "In our original discussion, B.G. told me that he was very discouraged because he felt he had “applied everywhere” and been unsuccessful.   In response to this, prior to our next meeting I produced a list of companies where I have placed many clients.  My primary purpose for this, in addition to creating a framework for our search, was to demonstrate to him that he had not in fact applied everywhere. Additionally, it introduced covering all bases by expanding the search to include other types of companies and positions. This seemed to lift his spirits and motivate him to take more ownership of the work we would do together.",
        "Before B.G. got to the point of receiving interview requests, we needed to solve the problem of his lack of transportation.  He told me that he was fine with walking to a job, but practically, this would limit the geographic scope of the search fairly significantly.  Unfortunately, he was not eligible to set up for taxi service through Department of Social Services, which would have been the only option for transport by car.  I asked whether he might be interested in biking to work and he was quite enthusiastic about the idea.  I have developed a network of individuals who can sometimes help to locate donated bikes.  I had one available at the time and gave it to him, allowing us to get beyond the transportation hurdle.",
        "We worked on filling out on-line applications together and began to visit potential employers to fill out paper applications as well as to personally deliver résumés.  In total, we completed 30 applications in the fast food, hospitality [maintenance], and retail sectors.  From these, B.G. interviewed with 5 potential employers.  He was informed that he was under serious consideration by 2 of the retailers, in addition to being immediately offered 2 positions in fast food establishments.  Both of the latter were part-time, but together provided him, on average, at least 40 hours per week.  Additionally, because of the hours of operation, he did not have scheduling conflicts."

        "B.W. has a limited non-professional engineering background in his native Iraq.  He is 60 years old and disabled with both upper-body and mobility impairment.  My contract allowed for up to 30 hours of employment assistance.",
        "He had established limited contact with the Department of Rehabilitative Services, but had not begun any formal job search.   After discussing his background and history, I suggested that our first stop should be a local company which concentrates on hiring both mentally and physically disabled individuals.  My contact in human resources there was able to meet with us immediately.  After reviewing his qualifications and interviewing B.W., she offered him a job beginning the next day.  Although some details of compensation remained to be determined depending on his work assignment, he was guaranteed at least a 30 hour work week which would suit him well.",
        "Significantly, I was able to place this individual in a suitable position, fulfilling my contract in a fraction of the allowed billable hours.  This resulted in considerable savings for the contracting agency."

        "D.L., a high school graduate and mother of 4, was employed when I was assigned her case and the position was a reasonable one in terms of both wage and position.  The problem was that she was working night shifts in order to be at home to see her children onto and off of the school bus.  The schedule was a grueling one and allowed little time with her children between the time they got home and the beginning of her shift.  Additionally (or perhaps as a result), her 6 year old was beginning to exhibit behavioral problems.  She had repeatedly asked her supervisor whether it would be possible for her to change to a daylight shift, but was told that no positions were currently available or likely to open up in the near future.",
        "We discussed her situation, which we agreed was multi-faceted.  Finding a day job of similar type and wage would then create the problem of after school child care and bus duties.  Additionally, the car she was using was borrowed and would soon no longer be available to her.  Both of these issues needed to be resolved concurrently with changing to a day job, assuming we were able to secure a suitable one for her.",
        "After creating a resume, we began to submit online applications and to visit potential employers primarily in the retail and food service sectors, which comprised her previous work experience. We investigated and D.L. applied for numerous positions offering the required daylight hours and wages comparable to her current position.  I also asked that she again check in with her supervisor to see if any daylight shifts had opened up or if the parent company might have anything else appropriate for her.",
        "While she worked on this, I tackled the other two barriers she faced.  Having worked extensively with several transportation-related non-profits, I ascertained that she was possibly eligible for assistance from one of them.  To qualify, we needed to set up and submit a budget for her along with her application.  While it proved to be a challenge to gather the pay stubs and other needed information, I was ultimately able to secure a donated vehicle for her.   Colleagues at DSS assisted in finding a choice of three daycares having the capability to drop off and pick up the children from the bus and provide after school care.",
        "D.L. continued following up on jobs, turning down a few that were seasonal or had low pay.  Ultimately, she called to let me know that, as advised, she had again spoken with her supervisor concerning daylight hours.  He seemed very impressed with her new found motivation and, when given a copy the resume which we created together, asked whether she would be available for a first shift supervisory role.   She elected to stay on and pursue this option and let me know that it most likely wouldn’t have been offered without the resume and help with strategic discussion points."

        "Z.O. had experience only in farming in her native Eritrea. She was married with 1 child and spoke and understood no English at all.",
        "The family did not have any daycare arranged so I contacted the contracting agency and requested an interview to get that process started.  Through an interpreter, I gathered her background information and began filling out applications for her signature.  After our meeting, I called my human resources contacts in a number of businesses to ascertain whether they would be willing to work with a non-English speaker for any positions they might have open.  Several were amenable, as long as an interpreter could be made available for both the interview and for training if she were hired.",
        "We proceeded to get her in for interviews at several places – challenging due to my having to synchronize an interpreter, transportation, and daycare each time.  During one promising interview with an employer I had vetted with regards to hiring a non-English speaker, she suddenly announced that she would be unable to fulfill the requirements of that position due to health problems.  According to the interpreter, asked if she wished to withdraw her application, she indicated that she did.",
        "Having previously heard nothing from her concerning this health issue, we discussed the situation with the aid of an interpreter.  She apparently was experiencing sharp pains in her legs and did not feel she could stand on any kind of assembly line all day.  I gave her a medical form to add to her file and worked to arrange transportation and interpretation for a doctor visit; I also counseled that she must not turn down jobs in the future without discussing the situation with me.",
        "I checked in with my contact at a local resort where I had submitted an application on her behalf, and after interviewing, she was offered a reasonable job in housekeeping.  She was to start the next day, requiring immediate resolution to both the daycare and transportation challenges.  Working with the interpreter, I obtained and hand-delivered the documentation needed for her child to attend the daycare that had tentatively been set up.  Transportation proved a thornier issue, but through a combination of neighbors and taxis, I was able to get her to work until she obtained the necessary documentation to utilize the resort shuttle.  At last check, she was performing her duties satisfactorily and the transportation and childcare elements were working out."

        "A recent transplant from Hawaii, E.N. lives in a homeless shelter with her 13 month-old child.  Not having lived in the area since she was a child, she is unfamiliar with employers and has no network of friends to assist her.  She has not completed high school and has several misdemeanor convictions and no record of long-term employment.  Additionally, she has a driver’s license but does not have access to a car, nor does she have childcare arrangements.",
        "Since E.N. had not begun to look for work at all, we registered her with the Virginia Employment Commission and created a résumé́ for her. We visited and filled out applications for local food service, housekeeping, and cashiering positions in person, as well as completing online applications.",
        "As she began to receive interview requests, E.N. indicated that she did not have any appropriate clothes to wear for them.  After receiving approval from the contracting agency, I took her to a discount store to purchase an outfit.  During her interviewing process, I assisted with transportation by arranging it through the shelter or at times by taking her myself.  She had been unhappy with one childcare situation she had tried, so was currently using her mother; this was working out satisfactorily so far.",
        "Having originally been called to interview for housekeeping at one of the chain hotels to which we’d applied, a front desk job had opened up there and she was offered her choice of the positions. She accepted the front desk work at a higher wage.  I arranged for transportation by taxi and on completion of my contract, the employment situation was working out well for her."

        "Over the previous 2 years , L.M. had had at least 10 jobs primarily in retail and fast food, none of which she had held for more than 3 months.  At present she was working part-time at Taco Bell.  She is the mother of 2 with no daycare other than her mother who also works.  She is a high school graduate who was convicted of misdemeanor assault and battery, for which she is on probation and must check in every Wednesday from 10:00 – 2:00.  Further complicating the situation, she does not and never has held a drivers license.",
        "Addressing this untenable scheduling situation had to be the first order of business.  I set as a primary goal for her finding reliable daycare to replace utilizing only her mother.  Throughout her job search, this continued to impact her current position at Taco Bell as well as her job search, resulting in the necessity to remind her of and enforce this goal.",
        "I counseled her in how to address her job history with prospective employers, as well as discussing the need to confront and work to resolve problems as they arise rather than simply quitting the position – particularly without having already secured another job.  Submission of myriad applications and visits with my extensive network of contacts within the market finally resulted in job offers from Wal-Mart and a local manufacturer.  She accepted the Wal-Mart position where she began work immediately. ",
        "Six months later, I was contacted to work with L.M. again when she was unfortunately laid off.  We decided that in addition to continuing the fast food and retail avenues, we would widen the search to include housekeeping jobs in local lodging.  After applying to 8 area chain hotels, she received interviews with several and ultimately was offered and accepted a position.  I set up taxi service to address her transportation issue.",
        "Within 4 days of beginning this job, L.M. contacted me wanting to know the ramifications of quitting because she did not get along with her supervisor and felt she was being targeted.  I responded that this would likely result in her no longer being eligible for the job search assistance she would need from the contracting agency.  I strongly encouraged her to stay, keep working at it, and give the situation a chance, to which she agreed.",
        "While completing employment verification documentation, I met with her supervisor and inquired as to her current job performance.  I was informed that she already had 2 infractions and would be fired if she incurred another.  I discussed this assessment with L.M., again stressing the need to perform to the best of her ability and work hard to resolve conflicts.  Once again, she agreed to stick with this employer despite her discomfort.  At my final assessment, L.M. appeared to be succeeding in performing her duties and earning  the approval of her supervisor."

        "An enormous departure from my typical client, C.J. was also one of my most challenging cases.  He holds a Doctor of Medicine degree from an African nation, as well as a Masters degree from George Mason University.  Unable to practice as a physician in the US prior to taking exams for graduates of foreign medical schools, obtaining a residency, and sitting for medical boards, he needed immediate work to support his wife and 2 children, with a third on the way.  While he was anxious to utilize his medical expertise, he was admirably open to work at any skill level or position.",
        "To help him get started with looking for medicine related jobs, I put him in contact with several local organizations which might have need for or ties to medicine.  I researched possibilities for physician mentors in the area who might offer assistance and answer questions while I got educated myself on this new type of job search.  Additionally, I began work on a resume for him using materials he supplied.  I searched local hospital job sites and we applied online for several non-physician positions, however the systems were not set up for entering his advanced qualifications which I felt had tremendous bearing on his suitability for the positions.  I contacted the HR departments to inquire whether there was any way to get the information to them other than online and was told that this was not possible.   I also contacted pharmaceutical companies, retirement homes, and home care companies, the last of which resulted in immediate possibilities.  C.J. interviewed with one and was accepted on the spot provided his references checked out.  He was offered a part time position as a home care provider, about which he was fairly excited.",
        "At this juncture I discussed continued job search with his case worker and was asked to help him find a better position.  C.J. had already applied for retail positions and we submitted paper applications for numerous others, as well as manufacturing and distribution center jobs.  Concurrent with pursuing these options, however, we were conducting an extensive search for US and foreign NGOs providing medical care to refugees, indigent people, and HIV infected populations, the latter for which he had extensive experience and passion.   All told, we submitted 50+ applications and in some cases had phone interviews with more than 15 worldwide organizations.   Many of these contacts led to additional organizations to research and possibly contact.",
        "At the conclusion of my contract, C.J. was getting rave reviews from his supervisors with the home health position and was in final discussions with another organization which helped disabled adults transition into more self-sufficient home settings.  I kept in touch with him over the next few weeks and learned that he had accepted a supervisory role at one of their satellite locations and was making considerably more money.   He was still hoping that one of the many international physician positions to which we applied would work out as well."
