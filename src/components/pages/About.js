        <p className="mission">
          Seth Blanchard grew up in the Shenandoah Valley and went to high
          school in Waynesboro, Virginia. After completing his Bachelorâ€™s Degree
          at Bridgewater College, he began working at a small company that
          provided contract services to the Harrisonburg/Rockingham Virginia
          Initiative for Employment not Welfare (VIEW) program at the Department
          of Social Services. Seth eventually migrated over to working directly
          for the VIEW program and enjoyed almost five years with the agency.
        </p>
        <p className="mission">
          During his time at the Department of Social Services, Seth became
          aware of a need for private employment services that were designed
          around focused goals and took into account the tremendous public
          savings which could be achieved with a results-driven approach. He
          developed the business concept and then opened Benchmark Employment
          Services and Training, LLC in 2012.

          BEST, LLC is currently available to provide services to Rockingham,
          Augusta, Page, Shenandoah, Rockbridge, Highland and Bath counties as
          well as all incorporated cities within these counties. We are also
          willing to open service availability in any county not listed.

        <p className="mission">
          Benchmark Employment Services and Training, LLC was founded out of the
          belief that government agencies should have access to private sector
          contractors who were willing to provide effective and high quality
          services while consistently keeping costs low.
        </p>
        <p className="mission">
          Since 2012, BEST, LLC has been helping families in the Shenandoah
          Valley become more self-sufficient by assisting with job search and
          prioritizing individual goals so that each client is able to become
          more self-actualized. We have primarily partnered with local VIEW
          programs but have been also branching out to helping clients from
          child protective services, foster care, and through several local FAPT
          teams.
